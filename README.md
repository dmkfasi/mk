# Redraw of arcade Mortal Kombat schematics

I actually messed up this a little bit.
The initial idea was to re-create original schematics from official arcade game manual. I started with freeware verions of
EAGLE, but then moved to KiCAD as an opensource alternative tool with no restrictions to the board size. I have completed
Sound Board only so far and not never finished board layout due to high load of discrete components.

Other folders contains:
Arcade Cabinet - few FreeCAD drafts about the cabinet itself,
and
MultiKickHarness - a condenser board to hook up all the auxiliar Low Punch, Low Kick and Run buttons if you happen to have
multiple boards installed into a single cabinet.
